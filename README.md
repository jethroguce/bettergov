# BetterGov.ph

A community-led initiative to create a better and more usable Philippine national government website.

## Why We're Building This Project

The current state of Philippine government websites, particularly the main portal [www.gov.ph](https://www.gov.ph), presents numerous challenges for citizens:

- The main Gov.ph website is outdated and has not been updated for a long time
- Full of broken links and difficult navigation paths
- Inconsistent formatting and design across pages
- Poor user experience and accessibility issues
- Similar problems exist across most Philippine government agency websites

These issues create barriers for citizens trying to access essential government services and information.

## Our Mission

We are a volunteer-led initiative with a clear mission: to provide a 'better' and 'usable' website for the Philippines.

Our goals include:

- Building a proper national website that reflects Filipino values and culture
- Creating intuitive navigation and search functionality
- Ensuring accessibility for all citizens, including those with disabilities
- Providing accurate, up-to-date information about government services
- Establishing a model for how government digital services can and should work

## Features

- Modern, responsive design that works on all devices
- Comprehensive directory of government services and agencies
- User-friendly navigation and search
- Accessibility features for users with disabilities
- Regular updates and maintenance
